 <summary>About Me</summary>

I love using data science to solve business problem. I started in Excel. Excel showed me the basics of reports generation, data modelling, and DAX. Those advanced functions led me to Power BI. I'm currently learning SQL and Python.

Everyone's got to start somewhere, and a little help and guidance goes a long way. These repos were originally created to store reusable codes from previous projects, but evolved into guides for the next generation of problem solvers. Explore my guides, as I made them along my career to explain the overly complicated.

- Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships - Eric Berne
- The art of small talk Debra Fine???

Beginner level is basic stuff you can inform yourself about anywhere.
Intermediate is applicable knowledge where it is much harder to find good models and processes.
Advanced this stuff is your own personal knowdledge base. 

Different types of learning environments: 
As a self taught person: Accepting only the stuff that makes sense.

https://www.youtube.com/@GuyInACube/playlists What are common table expressions?


Beginner SQL means being able to import, structure, and clean data.

Beginer level projects are 
Data cleansing to get an overview of an applicable environment.

Intermediate is using windows functions handling common problems.

How sql server works and performance

The best way for me to recreate this is to look at the code and follow along using the excel tables. That should give me an overview of some things. Reverse engineer this project with what I do have.
