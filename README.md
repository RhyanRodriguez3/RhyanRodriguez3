 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A8sQZDRn5o
