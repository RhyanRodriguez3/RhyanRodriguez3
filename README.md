 <summary>About Me</summary>

**`Digital Craftsman` `Data Janitor` `YT Graduate` `Problem Solver`**

I love using data science to solve business problem. My path began in Excel and grew to data visualizations using Tableau. Everyone's got to start somewhere, and a little help and guidance goes a long way. These repos were originally created to store reusable codes from previous projects, but evolved into guides for the next generation of problem solvers. Here's a few things for us to connect on.
