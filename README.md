Beginner level is basic stuff you can inform yourself about anywhere.
Intermediate is applicable knowledge where it is much harder to find good models and processes.
Advanced this stuff is your own personal knowdledge base. 

Different types of learning environments: 
As a self taught person: Accepting only the stuff that makes sense.

Beginner SQL means being able to import, structure, and clean data.

Beginer level projects are 
Data cleansing to get an overview of an applicable environment.

Intermediate is using windows functions handling common problems.
